## Objectives and Instructions
1. **Setup**: Initialize the project using Create React App.
2. **Tailwind and Flowbite Integration**: Integrate Tailwind CSS for styling and Flowbite components for UI elements like sliders and spinners.
3. **API Integration**: Use The Movie Database (TMDB) API to fetch data for different categories.
4. **Component Development**: Create React components for each section of the website, ensuring they are responsive and follow the design patterns shown in the reference website.
5. **Dark Mode Implementation**: Incorporate a dark mode feature that users can toggle.
